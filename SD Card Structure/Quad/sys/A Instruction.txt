This document explains how to set the correct configurations for this machine.

The sys folder contains a set of files, most of them should not be modified.
Some of them are machine generated, like for example the heightmap.csv file.
Here is the list of files the user can change and an overall guide on how to
configure those files. Each of those files has detailed instructions in them
under which circumstances and how that particular file has to be modified.

All the files the user should ever have to change start with the prefix machine_.
All other files can be changed, but should not be.

More in-depth guides and walkthroughs can be found on the Promega Docs website:

Print Scripts:
There are two scripts in the sys folder that make starting and stopping a print more convenient.
These two scripts can be modified by the user to accommodate their personal taste of what should happen before and after a print job.

print_startcode.g        This script should be called by the slicer on start of a print job.
print_stopcode.g         This script should be called by the slicer at the end of a print job.

To call those scripts from the slicer, use the following gcode commands:
M98 Pprint_startgcode.g
M98 Pprint_stopgcode.g

Initial setup:

Step 1 needs to be done on a computer with an SD card reader and a text editor the rest will be done through macros in the Printer Setup folder.

1. Set the machine name and IP address in machine_access.g
2. Run the macro 'Printer Setup -> _1_Calibrate_Z_Probe.g'
3. Run the macro 'Printer Setup -> _2_Set_Z_Endstop_Height.g'
4. Run the macro 'Printer Setup -> _3_Mesh_Bed.g'
5. Repeat from step 3 and recheck values if necessary

At this point in time, your printer should be ready for the first test print.
